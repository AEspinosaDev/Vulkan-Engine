<p align="center"> 
A Vulkan based 3D library that acts as a wrapper for the most verbose Vulkan parts that I implemented to learn the API.

It consists of two parts:

- The library itself, a place where you can find a lot of abstracted functionality.

- A demo application that links against the library.

The main feautures of the libray are:

- PBR, Phong and other types of materials abstractions.
- Scene and scene objects abstractions.
- Texture loading with mipmapping.
- On the fly shader compiling.
- Dynamic renderer states for some graphic features.
- Multipass (depth pass for shadows).
- Vulkan object and functionality abstraction.
- Simple to use user interface (Unfinished).
- Easy to distribute source code.

This project is finished for now, It has a long way until becoming a decent library, there are no fancy features for now, but all the basics are here. I will continue working on it in a couple of months, adding more advance functionality.
